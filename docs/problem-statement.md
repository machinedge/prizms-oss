The Problems I Face:

- I want help establishig what the "unkown-unkowns" are so that I can get smarter/better/more resilient in my thinking.
- I want different perspectives on a topic to challenge my thinking so that I can think through perspectives and develop more well informed and formed opinons.
- I want to check the output of LLMs against each other easily so that I can automate my manual process of manually haveing `n` chat windows open and manually managing the contexts and chats.
- I want to the interaction with LLMs to be less syncophantic so I can work on my thinking biases, and not have them inadvertently reinforced.
- I want to this to act like a journaling app, with some interactivty on a daily level so that I don't have to change my interaction patterns. I find the need to use `shift + return` annoying and distracting when expressing my thoughts.
    - Obsidan like journaling + project interface
    - ChatGPT or claude like interactivity (dialog, repsone)
    - Cursor like multi LLM automation
- I want it to automatcially build out a memory of the chats and update automatically so that the LLM can reference the latest important information as context.
    - daily/weekly/monthly/yearly summary per project/idea/thought
- I want the option to interact with local LLMs, so that I can keep information I feel is sensitive local and private.
    - on the same machine
    - on the same network
- I want the LLM to summarize it's thinking so that it feels more like talking to a human
    - One thing I've noticed is that the model produces too much text - it categorizes, breaks down the thinking patterns provides a solution and then a question to go on. An experienced consultant seems to have the process of:
        - Internal thinking to come up with a set of possible issues, each with a set of causes.
        - Implicitly, coming up with a "tree of questions" to gather data (planning). Usually the tree depth is no more than 5 (example 5-why's for root cause)
        - Asking questions, one at a time, and listening to the answers (data collection)
        - Then applying the information gathered to spit out a hypothesis about what could be going on.
        - Iterating until an internal gut says, the issue is mostly addressed for now.
        - Quote: 
- I want to keep all the data local, or in my own personal cloud space (iCloud,Dropbox etc) so that data can be kept private/encrypted
    - For example, I have a bunch of personal stuff, where I really just want to keep it private, but backed up. Fundamentally, I don't trust the LLM providers to not look at my data, or try and figure out how to monitize it, even though they have "user agreements". I would much rather just keep the data inaccessible to them if possible.
- I want to be able to migrate from one model to the next, quickly and easily
    - Models change quickly, and a real pain is that my chats and data are locked into a provider.`
