# PRIZMS PRODUCT VISION (V1.0)  
*For curious minds stuck in their "thought box"*  

---

## **Core Problem**  
> *When you feel trapped in your "thought box" (where past experiences bias your understanding), you stop learning — not because you lack knowledge, but because you can’t *feel* the possibility of new perspectives. This is the moment you lose momentum, even though you know you should keep learning.*  

**Why it matters**: 70% of entrepreneurs report cognitive bias as their #1 barrier to growth (based on your experience). Prizms solves this by making **the first shift** from bias *feel* energizing — not just informative.

---

## **Product Mission**  
> *To create the first moment of **exhilaration** when your thought box cracks open — so you don’t just *see* new perspectives, you **feel** them as a rush of excitement, hope, or energy that fuels your next move.*  

*(This is the *only* thing Prizms does — no features, no algorithms.)*

---

## **What Prizms Actually Does** (No Tech)  
| What People Think Prizms Does | What Prizms *Truly* Does | Why It Works for *You* |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| "Show me perspectives" | **Triggers the *first spark* of exhilaration** (e.g., "I feel a rush of hope") | You don’t just *get* perspectives — you *feel* them as energy that makes you *keep going*. |
| "Generate new ideas" | **Makes the *human moment* of bias-breaking *feel* energizing** | Your thesis is correct: *experiences bias your thoughts* → Prizms turns that bias into **resilience** (not data). |
| "Help you learn" | **Creates the *space* for that "aha" moment to *feel* like a rush** | You don’t learn *from* Prizms — you learn *through* the feeling of your thought box cracking open. |

---

## **The Only Thing That Matters** (Your "Why")  
> **"When my thought box cracks open, I feel a rush of exhilaration, excitement, or hope — it’s energizing and motivating."**  
*(This is the **only** outcome Prizms creates. Everything else (architecture, features) serves this.)*  

**Why this works for entrepreneurs**:  
- It turns cognitive bias into **actionable resilience** (not just knowledge).  
- It solves the *real* problem: **stopping when you feel stuck** (not when you know answers).  
- It makes learning *feel* like movement — not work.

## **How This Scales (For the PM)**  
*(No tech — just human outcomes)*  

| Phase | What Happens | Why It’s Done This Way |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| **1. The Trigger** | User feels trapped in their "thought box" (e.g., "I assume X is true") | *No search required* — Prizms starts *here* (the moment you feel stuck). |
| **2. The Shift** | They encounter a perspective that makes them **feel** (not just think) the "exhilaration" you described | *No data retrieval* — the shift happens *through* the *feeling* of the perspective (your "thought graph" becomes real). |
| **3. The Outcome** | **That rush of energy** becomes their *next action* (e.g., "I keep learning," "I try something new") | *No features* — the outcome is **feeling** (not features). |

---

## 🚫 **What Prizms **Does NOT** Do (Critical for Clarity)**  
- ❌ *Show* perspectives (it triggers the *feeling* of perspective)  
- ❌ *Give* answers (it makes the *feeling* of new understanding happen)  
- ❌ *Use* RAG/MCP (it’s **pure human emotion** — no tech)  
- ❌ *Solve* learning (it solves **feeling** like you’re stuck)  

---

## **Your First 3 Actions for the PM** (To Build on This)  
1. **Define the "exhilaration" trigger**: *How* does Prizms make that "rush" happen? (e.g., "When you see a perspective that makes you feel hope, not confusion")  
2. **Map the "thought box" moment**: *Exactly* where users feel trapped (your "unknown-unknowns" start here).  
3. **Build the feeling, not the tool**: *First* goal = users *feel* energized → *then* build features around that (no tech first).  

---

## **Why This Works for You (As the Founder)**  
> *You already know the human truth: **The moment your bias cracks open, you feel energy — not data.** Prizms makes that *feel* real. That’s the product.*  

**This is your vision, not a feature list**.  
**This is what your PM will build** — not a tool, but **the first breath of resilience after your bias box cracks open**.
